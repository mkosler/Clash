# Clash: A HaxePunk UI project

Clash plans to be a skinnable UI for the HaxePunk game engine. It takes
inspiration from the FlashPunk UI and susquent HaxePunk UI, while
providing a few new tweaks.

Additionally, after the initial project is done, I plan on releasing a
small skin editor that will allow you to easily create and import new
skins for the UI.

**This may take a while; but keep checking back for progress updates!**
